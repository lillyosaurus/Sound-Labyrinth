<p>Sound Labyrinth is an accessible videogame which is designed to provide the same experience to people with a range of sensory abilities. People with a visual impairment can navigate the game via audio input, while people who have hearing impairments can navigate with visual input. In the game, you find yourself trapped in the labyrinth, an endless maze between the world of the living and the dead. A place where souls are kept if they still have unfinished business, ties to the world or regrets for what they've done. In order to resolve your past life, you must now learn to help the other trapped souls move on. Only then can you yourself pass on to the afterlife.</p>

# Sound Labrynth
Sound Labrynth is a videogame which aims to provide the same experience through audio and/or visual feedback, so that the game can be played by people with varying levels of audio and visual preception. The game aims to provide the same experience to users who are visually impaired, audially impaired or who have no audio/visual impairments because the game can be played using audio, visual, or combined input. For a more detailed description of our plans for this project please see our "SoftDes Final Project Proposal.pdf" file in our repository.

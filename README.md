# 2019 Softdes Final Project
The main idea of our project is to create a game that provides the same experience for sighted and visually impaired players. The game is a labyrinth based game, where the player will navigate using audio and/or visual input. For a more detailed description of our plans for this project please see our "SoftDes Final Project Proposal.pdf" file in our repository.


## Install
This game uses the Pygame library, version 1.9.6. In order to run the scripts, you'll need to install Pygame. Do this by running the following command in Terminal: 

> pip install pygame

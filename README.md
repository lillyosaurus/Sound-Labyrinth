# Sound Labyrinth
Sound Labyrinth is a video game developed by Kyle Bertram, Lilly O'Saurus, and SeungU Lyu for the Olin college course software design during the fall semester of 2019. Sound Labyrinth aims to provide the same experience through audio and/or visual feedback, so that the game can be played by people with varying levels of audio and visual perception. The game aims to provide the same experience to users who are visually impaired, audially impaired or who have no audio/visual impairments because the game can be played using audio, visual, or combined input.

## About Sound Labrynth
Add content describing the game and goal for the project. also add screenshots of the game, a sumary of the etics related to it and possible improvemtns for ethical considerations
### Ethical considerations
In the process of making an accessible video game we had to consider the ethical implications of our work and the ethical impact that we might have. We strove to create inclusive gameplay, however we acknowlege that our game is still not accessable to everyone. We did not develop a tactile interface for people who need to experience their world in this manner, this would be a future improvemnt which can be made for the project however it is not something we had the time to complete for the scope of this project. The game can eventually be updated to provide a broader range of accessible features to service other user groups.

The story of the game deals with some weighty concepts including proposing questions about what the meaning of death is and the nature of an afterlife. The game is intended as a work of fiction which provides some concepts for the user to think about themselves. However it should be mentioned that this game is not intended for children.

The characters in this game are designed to appear as inhuman spirits. This allows them to be interpreted solely on their their motivations and regrets rather than being judged based on divisive human features, such as race or gender. An added benifit of this depiction is that the characters can be representative of any person and can allow users to more easily draw parallels between the characters and themselves.

### Ethical solutions/ future improvements that can be made.
We have discussed several further developments which can be added to the game to provide a better experience for a broader rane of people. What follows are a selection of proposed features which did not make it into the curent iteration of the game but can be added in further iterations.

- Key rebindings: This allows users with impaired dexterity and mobility to remap the control inputs to a method which better suits their abilities.
- Text resizing: This allows users with low vision to resize the text on their screen to make it more readable.
- Tactile feedback: This allows users to play the game via tactile vibrations and can open up the game to be played by more users who's abilities limit them to tactile expeiences such as the usergroup who suffers from both severe visual and severe auditory impairments.
- Internationalization: Currently the game and content surrounding it is only presented in English. The game could service a broader range of users by supplying internationalizations of the content.
- Implementing options or alternative fonts: The font used currently in the game contributes significantly to the style of the game, however it can be difficult to read for users with dyslexia or other similar impairments. A font chooser would allow the style of the game to be preserved for most users while providing the option to change the font for these users.
- Red/yellow color scheme: Users with cordical visual impairment respond more to metalic reds and yellows which seem to have more visual interest for these users, as a result a color scheme can be provided which tailors to this user group by changing the colors of the game to be presented in this color format.

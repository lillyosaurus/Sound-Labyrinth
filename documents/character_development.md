## The Fallen Ruler

![A small spirit with a tall three pronged crown and a sad regretful look on its face.](/../image/NPC3.png)

### Description


The creature sits in the middle of the room. Its two eyes seem to have a sad complexion to them. The long growths on top of its head resemble a crown crushing the creature and beating it wown. You can see that its spirit has given up and it is waiting out its torment.

### Dialogue

. . .

. . .

For what are you bothering me?

Why are you here? Have I not suffered enough?

Its all my fault ...

What have I done? ...

(The last two repeat until you bring him the royal sword)

NO! take it away. Didn't you hear? I can't. They are lost because of me.

They were so bright, so full of hope they had so much to live for. No ... No, I can't.

Have they moved on? is that why I can't find them. Oh please no they were all I have had left. I cant take up the mantle again.

I have told you I can't. Find somone more worthy then me, someone to carry on the legacy, someone to carry the crown. Bring it to them if they are still even here... Oh what have I done. Leave me.

(After you give the heir the sword the heir will appear beside the Ruler)

I can't believe it you returned to me. I failed you, I... 

I wasn't strong enough I couldn't stop them. They took you and I couldn't...

(Heir)
I... 

I forgive you. 

(Ruler)
You do? Why? 

(Heir)

Because you showed me the way. 

You couldnt stop them, but neither could I. You at least fought against them when all I did was run and hide. You showed me who to be and what our world needed.

### Dialogue
Hello again and welcome. Its about time that you pass through here. A lot of people have been waiting for this for a long time...

Ah you dont know where you are. Welcome to the labrynth, the endless maze between the world of the living and the dead. This place of suffering and madness is where souls are kept if they still have unfinished buisness, ties to the world or regrets for what they've done etc. 

Ah you you remember why your here. All of those people you wronged? All of those people you used then threw away when they were of no use to you. That didn't sit right with something in you. Now you have to pay the bill.

What to you need to do? I should think you figured it out by now. You have to make peace with that part of yourself. Prove that you are changed, that people mean something to you.

There are other souls here as well maybe talk to them se what they need. Do something for someone else for a change. What a concept.
